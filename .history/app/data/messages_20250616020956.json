    "intro": "大家好，我是 Scott。\n\n截止 5 月 27 日，已经有 634,120 人阅读了我找工作的故事。\n\n我总共投了 723 份简历，历经 269 天，接过 31 个 phone screen，经历了无数次模拟面试，14 次正式面试，5 次技术面，最后收获了 3 个 offer。目前我已经收获了全职正式的 offer。只有我自己知道，这一路走来有多么不容易。\n\n毕业后，我一边投简历，一边打工养活自己：IT 公司兼职、送外卖、洗碗、在餐厅端盘子…… 父母一直劝我回国，说语言熟、文化相通、机会更多。但我还是留在了澳洲。因为我喜欢这里城市与自然的融合，也渴望这里「工作与生活共存」的节奏。\n\n但现实很残酷。想找到真正「欣赏你」的公司太难了。\n\nJD（岗位描述）越看越困惑。一个岗位像是在招整个 IT 部门。每次看到 JD 都在怀疑自己：“这真的是我一个人能做的事吗？”为了不被淘汰，我只能不停学习、不停堆叠技能，在简历上“拼命卷”。可即便如此，面试机会依然寥寥无几。\n\n在图书馆的夜晚，我躲在天台偷偷流泪；在街头，我举起写着“HIRE ME”的牌子。我穿着西装，看起来很骄傲，很勇敢，只有自己知道自己内心多落寞。我很庆幸，我没有放弃。",

    "intro": "Hello everyone, I'm Scott.\n\nAs of May 27th, 634,120 people have read my job-seeking story.\n\nI applied to 723 jobs over 269 days, had 31 phone screens, endured countless mock interviews, 14 official interviews, 5 technical interviews, and finally received 3 offers. I've now secured a full-time offer. Only I truly know how difficult this journey has been.\n\nAfter graduating, I balanced job applications with various odd jobs to support myself: part-time IT work, food delivery, dishwashing, waiting tables... My parents constantly urged me to return home, saying the language was familiar, the culture aligned, and there were more opportunities. But I chose to stay in Australia. I love the blend of city and nature here, and I yearn for the \"work-life balance\" rhythm.\n\nBut reality was harsh. Finding a company that truly \"appreciates you\" was incredibly hard.\n\nThe Job Descriptions (JDs) only made me more confused. One role seemed to be recruiting an entire IT department. Every time I saw a JD, I'd doubt myself: \"Is this really something one person can do?\" To avoid being eliminated, I had to keep learning, keep piling on skills, and \"fight tooth and nail\" on my resume. Even then, interview opportunities were scarce.\n\nOn nights at the library, I'd hide on the rooftop, secretly crying; on the street, I held up a \"HIRE ME\" sign. I wore a suit, looking proud and brave, but only I knew how desolate I felt inside.I'm very glad that I didn't give up.",

You even offered to pay for my business cards, and though I didn't print them, I'll never forget you saying: \"You deserve a chance to be remembered.\" Every mock interview, every voice practice, every casual chat about life after discussing technical topics, even encouraging me to attend events to meet more people, were all part of my gradual journey to rebuild confidence. You told me to have self-respect, to love myself, and not to easily say \"sorry\" to appease others. Even when we scheduled time to prepare for my interviews, you told me not to completely adjust to others' schedules. You told me to love myself, and we hadn't even met, but I was truly touched. These words sound simple, but at the time, I genuinely couldn't be calm or confident. You slowly pulled me back from \"feeling inadequate,\" helping me start to believe: \"Maybe I can be good too.\" I always remember you sharing your own job-seeking experiences after graduation. That empathy wasn't just understanding; it was a true sense of companionship. Thank you, Aloe. When I was most alone, you made me feel like I wasn't.

You taught me that true preparation isn't about pleasing the interviewer, but about clearly seeing who you are. You emphasized confidence and conviction at all times, even adjusting my tone. You gave me many specific suggestions. After every conversation with you, my mind felt clearer, and my heart felt calmer. You wouldn't just give empty \"keep going\" encouragement; you'd help me break down problems, showing me how to do things, where to start, truly alleviating my anxiety, and making me more composed and confident. I know you pay great attention to detail and keenly observed every sign of my \"self-doubt,\" then gracefully but firmly guided me to see: \"You are already good enough; you just need to adjust your expression.

You asked me about projects I had done, how to introduce them. You didn't negate me; instead, you constantly inspired me, using the example of Airbnb to show me how to present your fit with a role, how to use \"similarity\" when talking about projects to build a sense of experience, and how to appear more professional in the eyes of the other person.

From helping me find a place to live and caring about the details of my life, to telling me, \"You can tell me anything, even if you're not satisfied, and I won't micromanage,\" I knew I had met a truly respectable leader. You gave me a sense of trust, not control."

I said, \"Actually, I don't really care.\" You paused for a moment, then genuinely said, \"I want to treat you with respect.\" I heard that, and my heart was truly touched. It wasn't just a polite phrase; it was a sincere expression from the team's culture. Thank you for choosing me, for giving me your trust, and for making me a part of BlueSky. I will strive to live up to this expectation, and I hope to grow together and achieve mutual success here with everyone. Your decision not only changed my current career trajectory but also rebuilt my confidence that \"the workplace can have warmth.\" Time will show that your trust today was a very wise choice."

Your selfless trust and dedication are the most precious gifts in my life."

The fact that you are not specifically mentioned on this page doesn't mean you are unimportant. I also remember your attention. You smiled at me offline, you left me messages to encourage me to keep going, you helped me share my story, and you encouraged me in the comment section. Everything, everything, I remember. I am extremely grateful to each and every one of you who has helped me or tried to help me. May your kindness bring you eternal health, eternal happiness, eternal love and eternal success. This brief encounter on the journey of life, I hope we will have more connections in the future. Wish you all the best."

You gave me a reason to see myself when I was at my most vulnerable, most lonely, and most likely to give up. I will forever keep this gratitude in my heart, and I hope that someday, I can become that light for others. I will pass on this love and light, striving to help those in similar situations as myself.\n\nAll this gratitude boils down to one sentence: Thank you for not letting me give up.\n\nI am not a particularly outstanding person, just an ordinary person unwilling to give up on a dream. I hope my story today can also be a reason for you to keep going.",
